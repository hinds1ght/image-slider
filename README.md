# JavaScript Image Slider

A fully functional image slider built with **vanilla JavaScript**. It includes **next/prev buttons**, **dot navigation**, and **auto-play functionality**. This project is a great practice for handling DOM manipulation, event listeners, and layout animations without using external libraries.

## Features

- Next and Previous buttons for manual navigation
- Dot indicators for direct slide access
- Auto-play with pause/resume on interaction
- Smooth slide transition using `transform: translateX`

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

1. Images are arranged side-by-side in a horizontal row.
2. JavaScript calculates the slide width and moves the container using `transform: translateX`.
3. Dots and buttons update the current index and active state.
4. Auto-play runs every 5 seconds and resets after each interaction.
